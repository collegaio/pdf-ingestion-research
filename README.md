## Getting Started

To get started, first install all the Python packages with PIP

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, boot up the notebook (you will have to install Jupyter)

```bash
jupyter lab
```

The notebook will be available at localhost:8888

You'll also need to create a file called `.env` to hold all the API keys.
