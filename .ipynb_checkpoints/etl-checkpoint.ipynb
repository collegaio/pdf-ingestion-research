ASU is home to the first school entirely dedicated to \\nundergraduate and graduate degrees and research in sustainability. Students are becoming \\nexplorers through Dreamscape Learn, a virtual-reality-based experience that puts them in the \\nmiddle of a story and increases how much they learn and retain; engineering students work in \\nlabs such as the ASU Startup Labs, which are filled with equipment such as 3-D printers, laser \\ncutters, CNC routers and more. Students also have opportunities to participate in pioneering \\nresearch in the Biodesign Institute and other centers, perform in the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed \\nASU Gammage, pursue entrepreneurial interests through the J. Orin Edson Entrepreneurship + \\nInnovation Institute, or become involved in the critical semiconductor industry. The Julie Ann \\nWrigley Global Futures Laboratory is where students can help make meaningful contributions to \\nensuring a habitable planet. Students in the journalism program produce and broadcast their own \\ntelevised nightly newscast in an on-campus, state-of-the-art newsroom as part of the Phoenix \\nPBS channel. Nursing students work at the Health Futures Center — a collaboration with Mayo \\nClinic — as well as at nearby hospitals, gaining practical experience as they help heal patients. \\nASU is home to the internationally renowned Thunderbird School of Global Management, which \\nhas been producing global management leaders for more than 70 years, as well as home to the \\nfirst undergraduate degree to be offered by Thunderbird School of Global Management. Students \\nin the aviation and air traffic control programs hone their flying skills in on-campus flight \\nsimulators and log flight hours at the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport. Forensic science majors get \\ntheir hands dirty by evaluating and processing simulated crime scenes. Other programs in \\nbusiness, health, integrative sciences and arts, law, public service, and teacher education can \\nalso be found on the campuses. ASU is also home to Barrett, The Honors College, which was \\ncalled the “gold standard” of the nation’s honors colleges by The New York Times. All students \\ncan take on an internship in their field of study, as well as have the opportunity to study abroad in \\none of 65 countries. Choices such as concurrent degree programs, accelerated degree options, \\nand the selection of 7.5- or 15-week semesters enable students to customize their college \\nexperience to exactly what they want it to be.E.

Financial support is available in the form of scholarships, grants, federal work-study, \\nloans and outside resources. Almost everyone, regardless of income, can qualify for some form of financial aid. More \\nthan 80 percent of all ASU students receive some form of financial assistance every year. The university, in partnership \\nwith the ASU Foundation for a New American University, along with alumni, civic groups, private foundations, individuals, \\nand federal and state governments, remains committed to helping our students reach their educational goals. In recent \\nyears, ASU has made unprecedented increases in the amount of university gift assistance awarded to our students. The \\nBarack Obama Scholars Program assists select Arizona students from families with low income levels. By combining gift \\naid (i.e., Pell Grants, SEOG, ASU Grants, University Grants, LEAP, and scholarships) from federal, state, private, and \\ninstitutional sources with Federal Work-Study, ASU will cover students' estimated direct costs of attending ASU (minus \\nthe Expected Family Contribution as determined by the FAFSA) for up to eight full-time, consecutive fall and spring \\nsemesters. ASU launched the innovative Scholarship Maintenance Plan, which allows for students on merit scholarship \\nwho are close to but did not meet the academic standards for scholarship renewal, to receive a portion of their \\nscholarship for the next year. This allows the student a chance to improve their performance with the goal of returning the \\nstudent to his/her initial scholarship award level the year after.  Most recently, the State of Arizona launched a state \\nfinancial aid program to make college affordable and accessible for Arizona students from low income families. The \\nArizona Promise Program provides financial assistance for Pell Grant recipients up to the cost of resident tuition, \\nmandatory fees and program fees after other scholarships and grants for up to four years for qualifying Arizona high \\nschool graduates. \\nCDS H  Page 29\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.\\nClass Subsections:  A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that \\nare supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings.

Affordable Policies\\nNYU now meets the full demonstrated need of our \\ntraditional first-year undergraduate students in New \\nYork without the expectation that students will take \\nout loans. In addition, President Linda G. Mills \\nexpanded NYU's commitment to affordability \\nthrough The NYU Promise, guaranteeing that every \\nundergraduate - domestic and international - who \\nstarted as a first year student admitted to our New York campus will not have to pay tuition if they have \\nfamily income under $100,000 and hold typical \\nassets and scholarships will be adjusted each year to \\nmeet annual tuition increases. \\nEND OF SECTION HIf your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or iniative to make your institution more affordable to \\nincoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income level, please provide the details \\nbelow: \\nState scholarship/grants\\nPrivate scholarships\\nFederal Nursing Scholarship\\nOther\\nAcademics\\nAlumni affiliation\\nArt\\nAthletics\\nJob skills\\nROTC\\nLeadership\\nMinority status\\nMusic/drama\\nReligious affiliation\\nState/district residency\\nAcademics\\nAlumni affiliation\\nArt\\nAthletics\\nJob skills\\nROTC\\nLeadership\\nReligious affiliation\\nState/district residency\\nMinority status\\nMusic/drama\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
