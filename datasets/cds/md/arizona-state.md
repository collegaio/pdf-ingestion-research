# B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

- For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2023-2024 Survey: [https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates).

In the following section for bachelor's or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:
- Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
- Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
- Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
- Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loans status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

## For Bachelor's or Equivalent Programs

Please provide data for the Fall 2017 cohort if available. If Fall 2017 cohort data are not available, provide data for the Fall 2016 cohort.

### Fall 2017 Cohort

|   | Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant | Recipients of a Subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant | Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan | Total (sum of 3 columns to the left) |
|---|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| A | Initial 2017 cohort of first-time, full-time, bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students | 3,871 | 1,329 | 6,063 | 11,263 |
| B | Of the initial 2017 cohort, how many did not persist and did not graduate for the following reasons: <br> - Deceased <br> - Permanently Disabled <br> - Armed Forces <br> - Foreign Aid Service of the Federal Government <br> - Official church missions <br> - Report Total Allowable Exclusions | 21 | 7 | 72 | 100 |
| C | Final 2017 cohort, after adjusting for allowable exclusions | 3,850 | 1,322 | 5,991 | 11,163 |
| D | Of the initial 2017 cohort, how many completed the program in four years or less (by Aug. 31, 2021) | 1,806 | 690 | 3,687 | 6,183 |
| E | Of the initial 2017 cohort, how many completed the program in more than four years but in five years or less (after Aug. 31, 2021 and by Aug. 31, 2022) | 411 | 142 | 689 | 1,242 |
| F | Of the initial 2017 cohort, how many completed the program in more than five years but in six years or less (after Aug. 31, 2022 and by Aug. 31, 2023) | 106 | 36 | 170 | 312 |

# Arizona State University Campus Immersion
## Common Data Set 2023-2024

### B22. Retention Rates
Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

- The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
  * Death
  * Permanent Disability
  * Service in the armed forces
  * Foreign aid service of the federal government
  * Official church missions
  * No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

### B22
For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.

**85.3%**

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023.

(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) * 100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered "retained" for EF reporting purposes.

# Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

### H1
Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking" undergraduates) in the following categories.

- Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
- Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.

### H15

If your institution has recently implemented any major financial aid policy, program, or initiative to make your institution more affordable to incoming students such as replacing loans with grants, or waiving costs for families below a certain income level please provide details below:

ASU has many financial aid options. Financial support is available in the form of scholarships, grants, federal work-study, loans and outside resources. Almost everyone, regardless of income, can qualify for some form of financial aid. More than 80 percent of all ASU students receive some form of financial assistance every year. The university, in partnership with the ASU Foundation for a New American University, along with alumni, civic groups, private foundations, individuals, and federal and state governments, remains committed to helping our students reach their educational goals. In recent years, ASU has made unprecedented increases in the amount of university gift assistance awarded to our students. The Barack Obama Scholars Program assists select Arizona students from families with low income levels. By combining gift aid (i.e., Pell Grants, SEOG, ASU Grants, University Grants, LEAP, and scholarships) from federal, state, private, and institutional sources with Federal Work-Study, ASU will cover students' estimated direct costs of attending ASU (minus the Expected Family Contribution as determined by the FAFSA) for up to eight full-time, consecutive fall and spring semesters. ASU launched the innovative Scholarship Maintenance Plan, which allows for students on merit scholarships who are close to but did not meet the academic standards for scholarship renewal, to receive a portion of their scholarship for the next year. This allows the student a chance to improve their performance with the goal of returning the student to his/her initial scholarship award level the year after. Most recently, the State of Arizona launched a state financial aid program to make college affordable and accessible for Arizona students from low income families. The Arizona Promise Program provides financial assistance for Pell Grant recipients up to the cost of resident tuition, mandatory fees and program fees after other scholarships and grants for up to four years for qualifying Arizona high school graduates.

Are these policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic?
