# Common Data Set 2023-2024

## B22. Retention Rates

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

- The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
  * Death
  * Permanent Disability
  * Service in the armed forces
  * Foreign aid service of the federal government
  * Official church missions
  * No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

## B22

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.

| Total students retained = Students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's programs as of Fall 2023 | 83.80% |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|

(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023) / (Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) * 100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered "retained" for EF reporting purposes.

# CS-C12: First-time, First-year Profile

Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023, including students who began studies during summer, international students, and students admitted under special arrangements.

## C9 Percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.

- Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.
- Do not include partial scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.
- Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
- If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data. For example:
  - If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
  - If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

|   | Percent | Number |
|---|---------|--------|
| Submitting SAT Scores | 22.93% | 1,371 |
| Submitting ACT Scores | 88.99% | 3,222 |

For each assessment listed below, report the score that represents the 25th percentile (the score that 25 percent of the first-time, first-year population scored at or below) and the 75th percentile score (the score that 25 percent scored at or above).

# J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

**J1** Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023  
For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

| Category                                      | Diploma/Certificates | Associate | Bachelor's | CIP 2020 Categories to Include |

# Financial Aid Definitions

**External scholarships and grants:** Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may require paperwork to receive the funds, but there are no limits to the amount the recipient can bring in or the number awarded.

**Financial aid applicant:** Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

**Indebtedness:** Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) by a student’s family to pay for postsecondary education. Financial aid “awarded” to replace all or a portion of the family’s loan is not to be included.

**Institutional scholarships and grants:** Endowed scholarships, annual gifts, and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

**Financial need:** As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution’s own standards.

**Need-based aid:** College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, or loans).

**Need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

**Need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

**Non-need-based aid:** Scholarships and grants, loans, and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded to a student who does not have financial need or awarded to meet a student’s financial need as determined by the institution’s financial aid office. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, or loans).

Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based aid:

1. Non-need institutional grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers
3. Non-need state grants
4. Non-need jederal grants
5. Non-need work-study
6. Non-need student loans
7. Non-need parent loans
8. Non-need private loans
9. Non-need jobs

**Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded to a student who does not have financial need or awarded to meet a student’s financial need as determined by the institution’s financial aid office.

**Non-need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

**Work-study and employment:** Federal and state work-study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.
