# B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category

Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.

1. Include international students only in the category "Nonresident."

2. Complete the "Total Undergraduates" column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: "Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school (or a GED equivalency) within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation."

5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens).

6. Nonresident - A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

## I1. Instructional Faculty by Category

Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|   | Full-Time | Part-Time |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| A. Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |

# J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS OF DEGREES CONFERRED

Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd majors as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.
