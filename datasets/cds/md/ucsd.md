## B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category

Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.

1. Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."

2. Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."

4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: “Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.”

5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens).

6. Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible non-citizens in this category. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

# Common Data Set 2023-24

The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:

* Death
* Permanent Disability
* Service in the armed forces
* Foreign aid service of the federal government
* Official church missions
* No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023

(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023) / (Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) * 100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered "retained" for EF reporting purposes.

Enter retention rate: `94%`

# C. FIRST-TIME, FIRST-YEAR ADMISSION

## C1. Applications: First-time, First-year Students

Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2023.

- Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.
- Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).
- Admitted applicants should include wait-listed students who were subsequently offered admission.
- Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.
- If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the “Another Gender” category.
- Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered “first-time students” for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.

**Need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate a financial need to qualify.

**Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason.

# H5. Number/Percent Borrowers and Average Borrowed Amount

Provide the number and percent of students in class (defined in H4 above) borrowing from federal, non-federal, and any loan sources, and the average (or mean) amount borrowed in the table below.

The "average per-undergraduate-borrower cumulative principal borrowed" is designed to provide better information about student borrowing from federal and nonfederal (institutional, state, commercial) sources.

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

## I1. Instructional Faculty by Category

Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|   | Full-Time | Part-Time |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| **A. Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows** | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| **B. Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status** | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| **C. Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status** | Exclude | Include |
| **D. Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like** | Exclude | Exclude |
| **E. Faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay** | Include | Exclude |
| **F. Faculty on leave without pay** | Exclude | Exclude |
| **G. Replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay** | Exclude | Include |

*Instructional Faculty and Class Size data will be available in May*

# Common Data Set 2023-24

**Full-time instructional faculty:** faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research).

**Part-time instructional faculty:** Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instruction faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

**Minority faculty:** includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

**Doctorate:** includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

**Terminal master’s degree:** a master’s degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).

|   | Full-Time | Part-Time | Total |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------|

# Common Data Set 2023-24

**Instructional Faculty and Class Size data will be available in May**

In the table below, please report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

**Class Sections:** A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

**Class Subsections:** A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the “100+” column in the class section column and 40 times under the “20-29” column of the class subsections table.

# J. DISCIPLINARY AREAS OF DEGREES CONFERRED

**Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.**

8415

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor’s degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution’s IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

# COMMON DATA SET DEFINITIONS

All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.

Items preceded by an asterisk (*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS document but may be present on individual publishers’ surveys.

Additional guidance for some terms, particularly those common with the IPEDS survey, may be found here:

[https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary](https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/public/glossary)

### *Academic advisement:
Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.

### Accelerated program:
Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.

### Admitted student:
Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

### *Adult student services:
Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.

### American Indian or Alaska Native:
A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment.

# Common Data Set 2023-24

**Applicant (first-time, first year):** An individual who has fulfilled the institution’s requirements to be considered for admission (including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

**Application fee:** That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student’s application for acceptance. This amount is *not* creditable toward tuition and required fees, nor is it refundable if the student is not admitted to the institution.

**Asian:** A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.

**Associate degree:** An award that normally requires at least two but less than four years of full-time equivalent college work.

**Bachelor’s degree:** An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education) that normally requires at least four years but *not* more than five years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes ALL bachelor’s degrees conferred in a five-year cooperative (work-study plan) program. (A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies.) Also, it includes bachelor’s degrees in which the normal four years of work are completed in three years.

**Black or African American:** A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.

**Board (charges):** Assume average cost for 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.
