| F. Total number with doctorate, or other terminal degrees | 2497 | 255 | 2752 |
|----------------------------------------------------------|------|-----|------|
| G. Total number whose highest degree is a master's degree but not a terminal master's | 450 | 78 | 528 |
| H. Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor's | 157 | 21 | 178 |
| I. Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other | 648 | 230 | 878 |
| J. Total number in stand-alone graduate/professional programs in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students | 546 | 250 | 796 |

**NOTE: Rows F, G, H and I should equal row A.**

## I2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2023 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full time plus 1/3 part time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students.

Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

| Fall 2023 Student to Faculty Ratio: | 19 | to | 1 |
|-------------------------------------|----|----|---|
| Ratio is based on number of students: | 65693 |
| Ratio is based on number of faculty: | 3394 |

## I3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

**Class Sections:** A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

**Class Subsections:** A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who meet at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

# FINANCIAL AID DEFINITIONS

**External scholarships and grants:** Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

**Financial aid applicant:** Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

**Indebtedness:** Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

**Institutional scholarships and grants:** Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

**Financial need:** As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

**Need-based aid:** College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

**Need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

**Need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

**Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

**Note:** Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
1. Non-need institutional grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers
3. Non-need athletic awards
4. Non-need federal grants
5. Non-need state grants
6. Non-need outside grants
7. Non-need student loans
8. Non-need parent loans
9. Non-need work

**Non-need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.
