# Common Data Set 2023-2024

## B2. Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category

Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution’s official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.

1. Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."

2. Complete the “Total Undergraduates” column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.

3. Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under “Two or more races.”

4. New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data: “Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.”

5. More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens).

6. Nonresident – A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category. Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

# Common Data Set 2023-2024

If necessary, please use this space to clarify your test policies (e.g., if tests are recommended for some students, or if tests are not required of some students due to differences by academic program, student academic background, or if other examinations may be considered in lieu of the SAT and ACT.)

> Through the fall 2024 entering class, standardized tests are optional for first year entering applicants. During this time, UMass Amherst will review applications with or without standardized test scores. Students who have taken the SAT/ACT exams are welcome to send their scores.

Please indicate which tests your institution uses for placement (e.g. state tests):

- [ ] SAT
- [ ] ACT
- [ ] AP
- [ ] CLEP
- [ ] Institutional Exam
- [ ] State Exam

If you selected State Exam, please specify:

## C9. First-time, first-year profile: National standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)

Provide information for all enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023, including students who began studies during summer, international students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements. Report the percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.

1. Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.
2. Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other scores.
3. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
4. If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data.
   - For example: If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other). If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

|                      | Percent | Number |
|----------------------|---------|--------|
| Submitting SAT Scores| 27%     | 1,429  |
| Submitting ACT Scores| 3.9%    | 207    |
