C. Has been removed from the CDS

D. In addition, does your institution use applicants' test scores for academic advising?  
 **Yes**

E. Latest date by which SAT or ACT scores must be received for fall-term admission: **N/A**

F. If necessary, use this space to clarify your test policies (e.g., if tests are recommended for some students, or if tests are not required of some students):  
 **All applicants are able to indicate whether they want to be considered test-optional or not**

## First-Time, First-Year Profile

Provide percentages for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023, including students who began studies during summer, international students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements.

### CDS-C9. Percent and number of first-time, first-year (students enrolled in Fall 2023 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.

Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores. Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item. Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.

If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data. For example:

- If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
- If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

The 25th percentile is the score that 25 percent scored at or below; the 75th percentile score is the one that 25 percent scored at or above.

# Common Data Set 2023-2024

## CDS H2. Number of Enrolled Students Receiving Aid

List the number of degree-seeking full-time and less-than-full-time undergraduates who applied for and were awarded financial aid from any source. Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid. Numbers should reflect the cohort awarded the dollars reported in H1. Note: In the chart below, students may be counted in more than one row, and full-time freshmen should also be counted as full-time undergraduates.
