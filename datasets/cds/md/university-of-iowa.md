## B2 Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category

Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 15, 2023.

- Include international students only in the category "Nonresidents."
- Complete the "Total Undergraduates" column only if you cannot provide data for the first two columns.
- Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."
- New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:
  - Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens.
  - Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were enrolled on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.
  - More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens).
  - Nonresident: A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.

- NOTE: Nonsidents are to be reported separately in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

**B4-B11: Graduation Rates**

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

- For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2023-2024 Survey: [https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates).

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

- Students who received a Federal Pell Grant*
- Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
- Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
- Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

*Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

### B22. Retention Rates
Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

- The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:
  - Death
  - Permanent Disability
  - Service in the armed forces
  - Foreign aid service of the federal government
  - Official church missions
  - Report total allowable exclusions
- The initial cohort should be adjusted by subtracting the number of students who departed for the above reasons.

|   |   |
|---|---|
| For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023. | 89.30% |

\[Retention rate = students from Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023 / Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort\] * 100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered "retained" for EF reporting purposes.

### C1
First-time, first-year students: Provide the number of degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who applied, were admitted, and enrolled (full- or part-time) in Fall 2023.

- Include early decision, early action, and students who began studies during summer in this cohort.
- Applicants should include only those students who fulfilled the requirements for consideration for admission (i.e., who completed actionable applications) and who have been notified of one of the following actions: admission, non-admission, placement on waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).
- Since the total may include students who did not provide gender data, the detail need not sum to the total.
- If your institution collects and reports non-binary gender data, please use the "Another Gender" category.
- Note that recent high school graduates and other students without prior postsecondary experience will still be considered "first-time students" for fall enrollment reporting purposes even if they enrolled in the summer prior to fall enrollment.

# H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

**Awarded aid:** The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

**Financial aid applicant:** Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

**Indebtedness:** Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans).

**Institutional scholarships and grants:** Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

**Financial need:** As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

**Need-based aid:** College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

**Need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

**Need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

**Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

**Note:** Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:
1. Non-need institutional grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers
3. Non-need athletic awards
4. Non-need federal grants
5. Non-need state grants
6. Non-need outside grants
7. Non-need student loans
8. Non-need parent loans
9. Non-need work

**Non-need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student does not have to demonstrate financial need to qualify.

**Private student loans:** A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union, or private lender.

**External scholarships and grants:** Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources by the student, with the institution's involvement limited to processing the paperwork to receive the dollars, but has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

**Work study and employment:** Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

**DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.**

## H1. Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, "total degree-seeking" undergraduates) in the following categories.

- If data being reported are final figures for the 2022-2023 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2022-2023 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
- Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
- Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
- For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for "non-need-based aid" above.
- **Note:** Do not include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

## I-1. Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include faculty who are on your institution's payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part-time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|   |   | Full-time | Part-time |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| B | Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| C | Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |
| D | Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses, but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |
| E | Faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |
| F | Faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |
| G | Replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |

**Full-time instructional faculty:** faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research).

**Part-time instructional faculty:** Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

**Minority faculty:** includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; or Hispanic.

**Doctorate:** includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes substantial degrees formerly designated as "first professional," including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (PharmD or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

**Terminal master's degree:** a master's degree that is considered the highest degree in a field; example, M. Arch (in architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).

### I-1.

|   |   | Full-time | Part-time | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Total number of instructional faculty | 1384 | 184 | 1568 |
| B | Total number who are members of minority groups | 294 | 18 | 312 |
| C | Total number who are women | 640 | 71 | 711 |
| D | Total number who are men | 744 | 113 | 857 |
| E | Total number with doctorate, or other terminal degree | 1247 | 115 | 1362 |
| F | Total number whose highest degree is a master's but not a terminal master's | 118 | 57 | 175 |
| G | Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor's | 15 | 10 | 25 |
| H | Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other (Note: Items f, g, and h must sum up to item a.) | 4 | 2 | 6 |
| I | Total number in stand-alone graduate/professional programs in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students | - | - | - |

## I-2. Student to Faculty Ratio

Report the Fall 2023 ratio of full-time equivalent students (full-time plus 1/3 part-time) to full-time equivalent instructional faculty (full-time plus 1/3 part-time). In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students.

- Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.
---
# Fall 2023 Student to Faculty ratio

| Ratio | Based on Students and Faculty |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| 15 to 1 | (based on 21125 students and 1379 faculty) |

## I-3. Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the Fall 2023 term.

- **Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.**

### Class Sections
A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

### Class Subsections
A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course listings.

Using the above definitions, please also report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in Fall 2023. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who meet at another time in 4 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section column and 4 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

### Number of Class Sections with Undergraduates Enrolled

| Undergraduate Class Size (provide numbers) | 2-9 | 10-19 | 20-29 | 30-39 | 40-49 | 50-99 | 100+ | Total |
|--------------------------------------------|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|
| CLASS SECTIONS                             | 526 | 883   | 800   | 223   | 122   | 224   | 149  | 2927  |
| CLASS SUB-SECTIONS                         | 35  | 237   | 765   | 423   | 47    | 20    | 2    | 1529  |
