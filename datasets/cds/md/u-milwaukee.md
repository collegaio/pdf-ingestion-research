# I. INSTRUCTIONAL FACULTY AND CLASS SIZE

## I1. Instructional Faculty by Category

Please report the number of instructional faculty members in each category for Fall 2023. Include faculty who are on your institution’s payroll on the census date your institution uses for IPEDS/AAUP.

The following definition of full-time instructional faculty is used by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP) in its annual Faculty Compensation Survey (the part time definitions are not used by AAUP). Instructional Faculty is defined as those members of the instructional-research staff whose major regular assignment is instruction, including those with released time for research. Use the chart below to determine inclusions and exclusions:

|   | Full-Time | Part-Time |
|---|-----------|-----------|
| A. Instructional faculty in preclinical and clinical medicine, faculty who are not paid (e.g., those who donate their services or are in the military), or research-only faculty, post-doctoral fellows, or pre-doctoral fellows | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| B. Administrative officers with titles such as dean of students, librarian, registrar, coach, and the like, even though they may devote part of their time to classroom instruction and may have faculty status | Exclude | Include only if they teach one or more non-clinical credit courses |
| C. Other administrators/staff who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses even though they do not have faculty status | Exclude | Include |
| D. Undergraduate or graduate students who assist in the instruction of courses but have titles such as teaching assistant, teaching fellow, and the like | Exclude | Exclude |
| E. Faculty on sabbatical or leave with pay | Include | Exclude |
| F. Faculty on leave without pay | Exclude | Exclude |
| G. Replacement faculty for faculty on sabbatical leave or leave with pay | Exclude | Include |

**Full-time instructional faculty:** Faculty employed on a full-time basis for instruction (including those with released time for research).

**Part-time instructional faculty:** Adjuncts and other instructors being paid solely for part-time classroom instruction. Also includes full-time faculty teaching less than two semesters, three quarters, two trimesters, or two four-month sessions. Employees who are not considered full-time instructional faculty but who teach one or more non-clinical credit courses may be counted as part-time faculty.

**Minority faculty:** Includes faculty who designate themselves as Black, non-Hispanic; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, or Hispanic.

**Doctorate:** Includes such degrees as Doctor of Philosophy, Doctor of Education, Doctor of Juridical Science, and Doctor of Public Health in any field such as arts, sciences, education, engineering, business, and public administration. Also includes terminal degrees formerly designated as “first professional,” including dentistry (DDS or DMD), medicine (MD), optometry (OD), osteopathic medicine (DO), pharmacy (DPharm or BPharm), podiatric medicine (DPM), veterinary medicine (DVM), chiropractic (DC or DCM), or law (JD).

**Terminal master’s degree:** A master’s degree that is considered the highest degree in a field: example, M. Arch (in architecture) and MFA (master of fine arts in art or theater).

|   | Full-Time | Part-Time | Total |
|---|-----------|-----------|-------|
| A. Total number of instructional faculty | 1014 | 573 | 1587 |
| B. Total number who are members of minority groups | 279 | 99 | 378 |
| C. Total number who are women | 508 | 326 | 834 |
| D. Total number who are men | 506 | 247 | 753 |
| E. Total number who are international (non-residents) |   |   |   |
| F. Total number with doctorate, or other terminal degrees |   |   |   |
| G. Total number whose highest degree is a master’s degree but not a terminal master’s |   |   |   |
| H. Total number whose highest degree is a bachelor’s |   |   |   |
| I. Total number whose highest degree is unknown or other |   |   |   |
| J. Total number in stand-alone graduate/professional programs in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students |   |   |   |
