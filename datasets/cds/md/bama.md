### B2 Enrollment by Racial/Ethnic Category

Provide numbers of undergraduate students for each of the following categories as of the institution's official fall reporting date or as of October 19, 2023.

- Complete the "Total Undergraduates" column only if you cannot provide data for the first 10 columns.
- Report as your institution reports to IPEDS: persons who are Hispanic should be reported only on the Hispanic line, not under any race, and persons who are non-Hispanic multi-racial should be reported only under "Two or more races."
- New guidance from IPEDS for reporting aggregate data:

Racial/ethnic designations are requested only for United States citizens, residents, and other eligible non-citizens. Eligible non-citizens include all students who completed high school or a GED equivalency within the United States (including DACA and undocumented students) and who were not on an F-1 non-immigrant student visa at the time of high school graduation.

More information about other eligible (for financial aid purposes) non-citizens is available at: [https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens).

Nonresident: A person who is not a citizen or national of the United States and who is in this country on a student visa or temporary basis and does not have the right to remain indefinitely. Do not include DACA, undocumented, or other eligible noncitizens in this category.

NOTE: Nonresidents are to be reported separately, in the boxes provided, rather than included in any of the seven racial/ethnic categories or in race/ethnicity unknown.

| Racial/Ethnic Category                                  | Degree-Seeking First-Time First Year | Degree-Seeking Undergraduates (Include First-Time First Year) | Total Undergraduates (Both Degree-Seeking and All Other Undergraduates Enrolled in Credit Courses) |

## B4-B21: Graduation Rates

The items in this section correspond to data elements collected by the IPEDS Web-based Data Collection System's Graduation Rate Survey (GRS).

-- For complete instructions and definitions of data elements, see the IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions for the 2023-24 Survey.

[IPEDS GRS Forms and Instructions](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/use-the-data/survey-components/9/graduation-rates)

In the following section for bachelor’s or equivalent programs, please disaggregate the Fall 2016 and Fall 2017 cohorts (formerly CDS B4-B11) into four groups:

- Students who received a Federal Pell Grant
- Recipients of a subsidized Stafford Loan who did not receive a Pell Grant
- Students who did not receive either a Pell Grant or a subsidized Stafford Loan
- Total (all students, regardless of Pell Grant or subsidized loan status)

**Note:** Students who received both a Federal Pell Grant and a subsidized Stafford Loan should be reported in the "Recipients of a Federal Pell Grant" column.

For each graduation rate grid below, the numbers in the first three columns for Questions A-G should sum to the cohort total in the fourth column (formerly CDS B4-B11).

### For Bachelor’s or Equivalent Programs:

Please provide data for the Fall 2017 cohort if available. If Fall 2017 cohort data are not available, provide data for the Fall 2016 cohort.

## B12-B21: For Two-Year Institutions - not applicable

## B22: Retention Rates

Report for the cohort of all full-time, first-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term).

The initial cohort may be adjusted for students who departed for the following reasons:

- Death
- Permanently Disabled
- Service in the armed forces
- Foreign Aid Service of the federal government
- Official church missions
- No other adjustments to the initial cohort should be made.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023.

Total students retained = students from the Fall 2022 cohort who are still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's programs as of Fall 2023

(Students from the Fall 2022 cohort still enrolled as of Fall 2023 + Students from Fall 2022 cohort who completed their bachelor's program as of Fall 2023)/(Adjusted Fall 2022 cohort) \* 100

Note: The number of first-time students seeking a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) who attain a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term is expected to be zero or very small. In exceptional cases when a first-time student does satisfy all degree requirements including full credit completion (e.g., typically 120 credit hours) and is awarded a bachelor's degree (or equivalent) by their second fall term, they are to be considered "retained" for EF reporting purposes.

For the cohort of all full-time bachelor's (or equivalent) degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered your institution as first-year students in Fall 2022 (or the preceding summer term), what percentage was enrolled at your institution as of the date your institution calculates its official enrollment in Fall 2023?

## First-time, first-year profile: National standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)

Provide information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, full-time and part-time, first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023, including students who began studies during summer, international students/nonresidents, and students admitted under special arrangements.

## C9 Percent and number of first-time, first-year students enrolled in Fall 2023 who submitted national standardized (SAT/ACT) test scores.

- Include information for ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.
- Do not include partial test scores (e.g., mathematics scores but not critical reading for a category of students) or combine other standardized test results (such as TOEFL) in this item.
- Do not convert SAT scores to ACT scores and vice versa.
- If a student submitted multiple sets of scores for a single test, report this information according to how you use the data. For example:
  - If you consider the highest scores from either submission, use the highest combination of scores (e.g., verbal from one submission, math from the other).
  - If you average the scores, use the average to report the scores.

### ALL enrolled, degree-seeking, first-time, first-year students who submitted test scores.

| Category              | Percent | Number |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Submitting SAT Scores | 23%     | 1,884  |
| Submitting ACT Scores | 54%     | 4,492  |

For each assessment listed below, report the score that represents the 25th percentile (the score that 25 percent of the first-time, first-year population scored at or below) and the 75th percentile score (the score that 25 percent scored at or above).

- A full academic year refers to the period of time generally extending from September to June; usually equated to two semesters, two trimesters, three quarters, or the period covered by a four-one-four plan.
- Food and housing is defined as double occupancy and 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.
- Required fees include only charges that all full-time students must pay that are not included in tuition (e.g., registration, health, or activity fees).
- Do not include optional fees (e.g., parking, laboratory use).

# H. FINANCIAL AID

Please refer to the following financial aid definitions when completing Section H.

**Awarded aid:** The dollar amounts offered to financial aid applicants.

**Financial aid applicant:** Any applicant who submits any one of the institutionally required financial aid applications/forms, such as the FAFSA.

**Indebtedness:** Aggregate dollar amount borrowed through any loan program (federal, state, subsidized, unsubsidized, private, etc.; excluding parent loans) while the student was enrolled at an institution. Student loans co-signed by a parent are assumed to be the responsibility of the student and should be included.

**Institutional scholarships and grants:** Endowed scholarships, annual gifts and tuition funded grants for which the institution determines the recipient.

**Financial need:** As determined by your institution using the federal methodology and/or your institution's own standards.

**Need-based aid:** College-funded or college-administered award from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify. This includes both institutional and non-institutional student aid (grants, jobs, and loans).

**Need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must have financial need to qualify.

**Need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, federal, or other sources for which a student must demonstrate financial need to qualify.

**Non-need-based scholarship or grant aid:** Scholarships and grants, gifts, or merit-based aid from institutional, state, federal, or other sources (including unrestricted funds or gifts and endowment income) awarded solely on the basis of academic achievement, merit, or any other non-need-based reason. When reporting questions H1 and H2, non-need-based aid that is used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.

**Note: Suggested order of precedence for counting non-need money as need-based:**

1. Non-need institutional grants
2. Non-need tuition waivers
3. Non-need athletic awards
4. Non-need federal grants
5. Non-need state grants
6. Non-need outside grants
7. Non-need student loans
8. Non-need parent loans
9. Non-need work

**Non-need-based self-help aid:** Loans and jobs from institutional, state, or other sources for which a student need not demonstrate financial need to qualify.

**Private student loans:** A nonfederal loan made by a lender such as a bank, credit union or private lender used to pay for up to the annual cost of education, less any financial aid received.

**External scholarships and grants:** Scholarships and grants received from outside (private) sources that students bring with them (e.g., Kiwanis, National Merit scholarships). The institution may process paperwork to receive the dollars, but it has no role in determining the recipient or the dollar amount awarded.

## **Work study and employment:** Federal and state work study aid, and any employment packaged by your institution in financial aid awards.

**DO NOT INCLUDE ANY AID RELATED TO THE CARES ACT OR UNIQUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC**

## Aid Awarded to Enrolled Undergraduates

### H1

Enter total dollar amounts awarded to enrolled full-time and less than full-time degree-seeking undergraduates (using the same cohort reported in CDS Question B1, “total degree-seeking” undergraduates) in the following categories.

- If the data being reported are final figures for the 2022-2023 academic year (see the next item below), use the 2022-2023 academic year's CDS Question B1 cohort.
- Include aid awarded to international students (i.e., those not qualifying for federal aid).
- Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be reported in the need-based aid column.
- For a suggested order of precedence in assigning categories of aid to cover need, see the entry for “non-need-based scholarship or grant aid” on the last page of the definitions section.
- Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## H2 Number of Enrolled Students Awarded Aid

List the number of degree-seeking full-time and less-than-full-time undergraduates who applied for and were awarded financial aid from any source.

- Aid that is non-need-based but that was used to meet need should be counted as need-based aid.
- Numbers should reflect the cohort awarded the dollars reported in H1.
- In the chart below, students may be counted in more than one row, and full-time, first-time, first-year students should also be counted as full-time undergraduates.
- Do NOT include any aid related to the CARES Act or unique to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## H5 Number and percent of students in class (defined in H4 above) borrowing from federal, non-federal, and any loan sources, and the average (or mean) amount borrowed.

- The "Average per-undergraduate-borrower cumulative principal borrowed," is designed to provide better information about student borrowing from federal and nonfederal (institutional, state, commercial) sources.
- The numbers, percentages, and averages for each row should be based only on the loan source specified for the particular row. For example, the federal loans average (row B) should only be the cumulative average of federal loans and the private loans average (row E) should only be the cumulative average of private loans.

In the ratio calculations, exclude both faculty and students in stand-alone graduate or professional programs such as medicine, law, veterinary, dentistry, social work, business, or public health in which faculty teach virtually only graduate-level students.

- Do not count undergraduate or graduate student teaching assistants as faculty.

**Fall 2023 Student to Faculty ratio**: 19 to 1 (based on 31,923 students and 1,681 faculty)

## I-3 Undergraduate Class Size

In the table below, please use the following definitions to report information about the size of classes and class sections offered in the **Fall 2023** term.

- **Please include classes that have been moved online in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.**

**Class Sections**: A class section is an organized course offered for credit, identified by discipline and number, meeting at a stated time or times in a classroom or similar setting, and not a subsection such as a laboratory or discussion session. Undergraduate class sections are defined as any sections in which at least one degree-seeking undergraduate student is enrolled for credit. Exclude distance learning classes and noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Exclude students in independent study, co-operative programs, internships, foreign language taped tutor sessions, practicums, and all students in one-on-one classes. Each class section should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of course catalog cross-listings.

**Class Subsections**: A class subsection includes any subsection of a course, such as laboratory, recitation, and discussion subsections that are supplementary in nature and are scheduled to meet separately from the lecture portion of the course. Undergraduate subsections are defined as any subsections of courses in which degree-seeking undergraduate students enrolled for credit. As above, exclude noncredit classes and individual instruction such as dissertation or thesis research, music instruction, or one-to-one readings. Each class subsection should be counted only once and should not be duplicated because of cross-listings.

## Using the above definitions, please report for each of the following class-size intervals the number of class sections and class subsections offered in **Fall 2023**. For example, a lecture class with 800 students who met at another time in 40 separate labs with 20 students should be counted once in the "100+" column in the class section column and 40 times under the "20-29" column of the class subsections table.

# J. Disciplinary areas of DEGREES CONFERRED

## J1 Degrees conferred between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023

For each of the following discipline areas, provide the percentage of diplomas/certificates, associate, and bachelor's degrees awarded. To determine the percentage, use majors, not headcount (e.g., students with one degree but a double major will be represented twice). Calculate the percentage from your institution's IPEDS Completions by using the sum of 1st and 2nd majors for each CIP code as the numerator and the sum of the Grand Total by 1st Majors and the Grand Total by 2nd major as the denominator. If you prefer, you can compute the percentages using 1st majors only.

## Common Data Set Definitions

-- All definitions related to the financial aid section appear at the end of the Definitions document.

-- Items preceded by an asterisk (\*) represent definitions agreed to among publishers which do not appear on the CDS document but may be present on individual publishers' surveys.

-- Additional guidance for some terms, particularly those common with the IPEDS survey, may be found here:

### \*Academic advisement

Plan under which each student is assigned to a faculty member or a trained adviser, who, through regular meetings, helps the student plan and implement immediate and long-term academic and vocational goals.

### Accelerated program

Completion of a college program of study in fewer than the usual number of years, most often by attending summer sessions and carrying extra courses during the regular academic term.

### Admitted student

Applicant who is offered admission to a degree-granting program at your institution.

### \*Adult student services

Admission assistance, support, orientation, and other services expressly for adults who have started college for the first time, or who are re-entering after a lapse of a few years.

### American Indian or Alaska Native

A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America) and maintaining tribal affiliation or community attachment.

### Applicant (first-time, first year)

An individual who has fulfilled the institution's requirements to be considered for admission (including payment or waiving of the application fee, if any) and who has been notified of one of the following actions: admission, nonadmission, placement on the waiting list, or application withdrawn (by applicant or institution).

### Application fee

That amount of money that an institution charges for processing a student's application for acceptance. This amount is not creditable toward tuition and required fees, nor is it refundable if the student is not admitted to the institution.

### Asian

A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.

### Associate degree

### Bachelor's degree

An award (baccalaureate or equivalent degree, as determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education) that normally requires at least four years but not more than five years of full-time equivalent college-level work. This includes ALL bachelor's degrees conferred in a five-year cooperative (work-study plan) program. (A cooperative plan provides for alternate class attendance and employment in business, industry, or government; thus, it allows students to combine actual work experience with their college studies.) Also, it includes bachelor's degrees in which the normal four years of work are completed in three years.

### Black or African American

A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.

### Board (charges)

Assume average cost for 19 meals per week or the maximum meal plan.

### Books and supplies (costs)

Average cost of books and supplies. Do not include unusual costs for special groups of students (e.g., engineering or art majors), unless they constitute the majority of students at your institution.

### Calendar system

The method by which an institution structures most of its courses for the academic year.

### Campus Ministry

## Religious student organizations (denominational or nondenominational) devoted to fostering religious life on college campuses. May also refer to Campus Crusade for Christ, an interdenominational Christian organization.
